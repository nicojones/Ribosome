;     path = <desired_path> ; no leading slash
;     action = <Controller_Name>@<Action_Name> ; don't write "Controller", just its name
;     after_login = 1 ; (or 0. OPTIONAL and 0 by default.<br/>
;                   This means: if on first attempt it has no permission, can the user be auto-redirected after login?)

;                   Will only enter if $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] matches
;     condition = '$_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] == "localhost"' ; OPTIONAL.
;                   If set, the code will be evaluated (function: eval()) as a further filter
;     default[animal] = dog
;     default[sound] = bark ; This is optional! but /zoo/:animal/:sound will match for /zoo, /zoo/<any_animal> and
;                             /zoo/<any_animal>/<any_sound> all in only one route! (use it for things like /blogpost/:page/:number
;                             with :page = page and :number = 1 as defaults. Hence /blogpost is page 1 and /blogpost/page/2 is page 2)
