; You can prepend "Vendor\" (optionally) to the keys if you're concerned about conflicts.
; Conflicts can and should only happen with the /src/config and /app/config routes; however, it's a safe measure
;   if you believe there might be another route with the same name.
;
; After you can get the path both by $this->url('Example') and $this->url('Vendor\Example'). This was added as a precaution
;   because any added plugin (vendor) might create a routing conflict (say, Settings, or Admin, which are common keys for a route)

; Note: Don't forget to specify the full namespace \Vendor\<sub-namespace>\<controllerName>::<action> for the action key!!!
